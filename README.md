the HTML span element used for holding the option answers, does not respond to perfect alignment.

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps for the deployment are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, I navigated to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, I select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page was automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
